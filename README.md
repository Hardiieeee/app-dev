<h1> 
  **The Good Doctor** 
</h1>


<p1>
The series follows Shaun Murphy, a young autistic surgeon from the small city of Casper, Wyoming, where he had a troubled past. He relocates to San Jose, California, to work at the prestigious San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.</p>

<p1>The premise of The Good Doctor centres on the main character's difficulties in interpersonal relationships and communication, so it is interesting to analyse qualitatively how these difficulties intersect with bioethical principles and the doctor-patient relationship in the series.</p1>
